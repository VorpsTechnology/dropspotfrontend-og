  Due to the rapid development of the Internet, the terms and conditions outlined in this agreement between you and Dropspot cannot fully list and cover all the rights 
  and obligations of you and Dropspot, nor can the existing agreement fully meet the needs of future development.
  <b>Therefore, the legal statement, privacy policy, rules, and dispute policy of Dropspot shall be deemed as supplementary agreements to this agreement, which shall be inseparable from this agreement and have the same legal effect. You agree to the above supplementary agreements if you use CJ services.</b>
